    <h1 class="header">Hard skills vs soft skills</h1>
    <p class="info">
        Hard skills and soft skills are two different types of skills that are necessary in todayâ€™s job market. Hard
        skills are technical skills for a specific job; they can be learned through experience, education, training.
        Examples of hard skills include language knowledge, programming languages, typing speed. On the other hand, soft
        skills are skills that are connected with personality and behavior. These skills help people to effectively
        communicate with each other, work together. Examples of soft skills include teamwork, leadership, time
        management, creativity, self-motivation, problem-solving. Hard skills are important for <strong>completing
            administrative tasks</strong> and duties, while soft skills are important for building relationships between
        staff. You should have both of these skills because it is important for employers. Hard and soft skills help
        <strong>to meet deadlines, motivate staff, increase energy levels, and lower stress levels</strong>. In
        conclusion, I would like to say that to be more successful in any role, you should have a combination of
        relevant hard skills and soft skills.
