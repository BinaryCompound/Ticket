    <h1 class="header">personality and skills of a prospective teacher</h1>
    <p class="info">
        Teaching is a <strong>rewarding</strong> job, and a prospective teacher should have special skills. Teacher
        duties include <strong>grading papers</strong>, homework, making a lesson plan, and of course, making
        communication with students better. And special skills can help a person to build a successful teaching career.
        In my opinion, a prospective teacher should have such soft skills as patience, time management, and
        communication. Very important hard skills are computer skills because part of the work a teacher can do on the
        computer. Besides, a prospective teacher should be open-minded and self-confident. Of course, a teacher should
        be organized and <strong>knowledgeable</strong>. A prospective teacher should be hardworking to <strong>complete
            the administrative tasks and meet deadlines</strong>. Also, it is important for a teacher <strong>to engage
            students in the subject</strong>, that's why a prospective teacher may be creative. All these skills and
        personality will help prospective teachers to <strong>motivate students, increase energy levels</strong>, and
        <strong>boost job performance</strong>. So, if you want to become a teacher, you should develop your personality
        and skills.
