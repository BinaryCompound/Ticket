    <h1 class="header">future of education</h1>
    <p class="info">
        Nowadays education plays very very important role in our society. and of course it will be important and popular
        in future too. It seems to me something in education can change. In my opinion, in future will be mostly
        <strong>distance learning</strong> and it may be personalised becouse if has a lot of advantages. <strong>It saves time, money and
            energy</strong>. This form of education offers <strong>flexibility to the student and give more freedom in the schedule</strong>. And i
        think that <strong></strong>(online courses ) will be more <strong></strong>(suitable for teenagers). It is useful becouse teenagers will learn to
        <strong>create their work space properly and to develop their own strategies</strong>. But such education can has <strong>challenges</strong>,
        for example one of the challenges is the need of teachers to adapt to new technologies and methods. this
        learning will <strong>make a big difference to peopleâ€™s lives</strong>. Also, in my opinion, future education should be more
        accessible to creat the same opportunities for all students.
