    <h1 class="header">Who is a scientist</h1>
    <p class="info">
        Science is an important part of our life. It helps us to understand this world, to solve different problems, and
        makes our life easier. A scientist is a person who studies science. This person can <strong>monitor</strong> and
        <strong>regulate</strong> experiments, he may <strong>indicate</strong> problems and something like that.
        Besides, <strong>their duties include</strong> analyzing the data and making discoveries. Scientists can work in
        different fields such as chemistry, biology, medicine, etc. There <strong>can also be drawbacks</strong> to
        being a scientist because it is very <strong>challenging</strong> and hard work. They also should <strong>have
            enough patience, they should complete difficult administrative tasks</strong>. Scientists play the greatest
        role in our understanding of the world, help us develop new technologies. They can find ways to solve problems
        and always have a <strong>brilliant idea</strong> to make our lives better. In conclusion, I would like to say
        that scientists <strong>make a big difference to peopleâ€™s lives</strong> and <strong>share</strong> useful
        things with us.
