        Science is an important part of our life. It helps us to understand this world, to solve different problems, and
        makes our life easier. A scientist is a person who studies science. This person can <strong>monitor</strong> and
        <strong>regulate</strong> experiments, he may <strong>indicate</strong> problems and something like that.
        Besides, these people analyze the data and make discoveries and of course make a <strong>positive
            impact</strong> on our life. There are a lot of different scientists, and I would like to tell you about
        Stephen Hawking. He was born in 1942. He was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author. He made
        the greatest contributions to our understanding of the universe through his work on black holes. He published
        his work in the forms of books and essays. His most famous work is considered to be A Brief History Time. This
        book became an international bestseller and sold over 10 million copies in 20 years. He had a serious disease
        but in spite of this, he is one of the most famous scientists and he made a <strong>big difference to peopleâ€™s
            life.</strong>
