    </h1>
    <p class="info">Inventions are a very important part of our life. They make our life easier. One of the most popular
        future inventions is considered to be a time machine. This machine can move people from the past to the future
        and back. Besides, it will be very useful to have a device which can <strong>translate</strong> different
        languages. It will make communication easier and more interesting. <strong>Another invention</strong> which can
        be very useful is a device which will help blind people to see. It will be a huge breakthrough. Also, it will be
        good to have <strong>a gadget</strong> that can help to save our planet. It will remove all the
        <strong>harmful</strong> and toxic things from nature and make it clean. In conclusion, I would like to say that
        future inventions can make our life easier and more interesting. They have a <strong>positive impact</strong> on
        every aspect of our life.
