        Today science is an important part of our life. Nowadays science helps us to solve <strong>challenges</strong>
        and develops faster and better. One of the most important problems for scientists is the environment. Scientists
        produce more and more <strong>biodegradable</strong>, <strong>eco-friendly</strong>, and
        <strong>disposable</strong> products because it will help to save our planet. Another important problem is
        health. Scientists <strong>monitor</strong> and <strong>regulate</strong> different diseases and look for
        medicine. Today we already have smart robots, multifunctional gadgets which can make our everyday
        <strong>duties</strong>. In my opinion, scientists have a lot of <strong>brilliant ideas</strong> about space
        exploration. Today it develops stronger and <strong>outcomes</strong> are existing. In the future, new
        technologies will make space travel more available. In conclusion, I would like to say that today science plays
        a gray role in our society. It makes a <strong>positive impact</strong> on every aspect of our life.
