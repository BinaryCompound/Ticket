    <h1 class="header">My future life</h1>
    <p class="info">
        When I'm thinking about my future, I cannot say for sure what it will be like. But I am sure that the most
        important things for me in the future will be my profession and family. I want to become a teacher. It seems to
        me it is a <strong>challenging</strong> job which has a lot of <strong>benefits</strong> and some
        <strong>drawbacks</strong> too. I really have a great interest in the Russian language and want to
        <strong>share</strong> my knowledge with others. So, I think this job makes a <strong>positive impact on
            people’s lives</strong>. I would like to finish my university to become a <strong>well-qualified</strong>
        teacher. Also, I would like to have any special training courses for teachers to improve my soft and hard
        skills. I believe that in the future, I will be a successful person who won’t be afraid to <strong>meet
            challenges</strong>, who will <strong>meet deadlines, motivate</strong> others, and <strong>complete
            administrative tasks</strong>. Besides, I would like to have a big family. The best holidays for me are
        holidays that I spend with my relatives and family. I want to believe that in the future, I will travel a lot
        because it is very important for me. I would meet interesting people and explore new places. This kind of
        holiday will <strong>increase my energy levels</strong>.
