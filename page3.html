    <h1 class="header">The role of education in society
    </h1>
    <p class="info">
        At the beginning i would like to say that education plays a very important role in our life and in society. It
        seems to me the first reason why it is important is personal development. Education helps people to get
        knowledge and <strong>hard and soft skills</strong> which can help them in their future life. If a person
        <strong></strong>(faced with
        challenges) he will know how to solve them. the second reason is that if you have education it will helps you to
        build a successful career and become a <strong>well-qualified</strong> and <strong>highly motivated</strong>
        person and it is very important
        for many people because it is connected with salary. Everyone hope for a sustainable future. So when you
        <strong>graduated</strong> from any education place you have necessary skills and knowledge that will help you
        become a
        specialist.
        also, in my opinion, education has social function because it learns people to communicate with each other.
        Besides, we should say that education plays a great role in development of science and technology. New
        technologies and inventions are made by educated people.
        In conclusion, I would like to say that education plays a very important role in society and makes
        <strong>positive
            impact</strong> on it and i canâ€™t say any <strong>drawbacks</strong>.
