        Choosing a higher education path is always hard. You should be sure that you study something you like and you
        really want to make a career in this field. I am going to tell you about my <srong>university experience</srong>
        , and why I
        chose it. now i am a <strong>first year</strong> student of herzen university, at the <strong>faculty</strong>
        of Filology, and when I finish
        it I will <strong>get a bachelor’s degree</strong>. I’m on <strong>face-to-face learning</strong> and it seems
        to me <strong>face-to-face
            interactions with teachers</strong> are more effective than distance learning. Most of the teaching in my
        university is
        done through <strong>lectures</strong>, all <strong>professors</strong> and teachers are
        <strong>patient</strong>, <strong>knowledgeable</strong> and highly <strong>qualified</strong> and
        highly <strong>motivated</strong>. They <strong>read course materials</strong> and <strong>share</strong> their
        knowledge with us very interesting and i see
        that they <strong>dedicated</strong> to the profession. It seems to me choosing a university is very important
        part in
        teenagers life, and teenagers should think about it seriously.
