    <h1 class="header">My family tradition </h1>
    <p class="info">
        The family is an important part of our life. Of course there are some unique traditions in every family. My
        family is <strong>rich in traditions</strong>. In my opinion, it is really important to <strong>keep up</strong>
        special traditions in family
        because it makes family members closer and can make better relationships between them. Besides, it is important
        to <strong>pass the tradition down to the next generation</strong>.
        In my family, there are some traditions. Many of them connected with some holidays. The most important is New
        Year. We <strong>decorate the house, cook and eat special food, dress up and watch a firework display</strong>.
        The main thing
        is to do it together.
        Also, we <strong>establish a tradition</strong>. This is to spend the sunday together. Sometimes my parents
        <strong>works overtime</strong>
        that’s why we don’t always have enough time to spend together this is a big <strong>drawback</strong> and i
        <strong>get frustrated</strong>.
        But we trying to spend every sunday together. We can go for a walk, we may go to the cinema. <strong>By
            tradition</strong> in
        the evening we have a dinner together. It seems to me, all these traditions have <strong>positive
            impacts</strong> on our
        family relationships. In conclusion, i would like to say that i think if you have any traditions in your family
        your life will be better. All traditions <strong>make a big difference to people’s lives</strong> and i think
        everyone should
        has traditions in their life.
