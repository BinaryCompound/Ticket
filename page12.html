    <h1 class="header">my future profession </h1>
    <p class="info">
        My future profession is teaching. It seems to me it is <strong>challenging</strong> and
        <strong>rewarding</strong> job. But also, it is very important and it makes a <strong>positive impact</strong>
        on society. Besides, there are many <strong>benefits to a teaching career</strong>. For example,
        <strong>healthcare and retirement benefits</strong>. They will be very useful in the future. And the most
        interesting benefits are <strong>extended vaccinations</strong>. In spite of these benefits, <strong>there can
            also be drawbacks to becoming a teacher</strong>. Teachers should have enough time <strong>to grade
            papers</strong> and homework. And sometimes, teachers may <strong>work overtime</strong>, but I believe that
        there is additional pay for this. Teachers should be patient and hardworking to <strong>complete the
            administrative tasks and meet deadlines</strong>. Also, it is important for teachers <strong>to engage
            students in the subject</strong>, that's why teachers should make a good lesson plan. In conclusion, I would
        like to say that as a prospective teacher, I think that this job <strong>makes a big difference to people’s
            lives</strong> and if you want to build a successful career, it’s important to be <strong>dedicated to
            teaching</strong>.
