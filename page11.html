    <h1 class="header">if i were an inventor </h1>
    <p class="info">
        if i were an inventor, i would create a device that could transport people from one place to another. This
        invention would save our time and money. It seems to me it would be a <strong>rational</strong> decision. My
        invention would be the greatest invention and would have <strong>benefits</strong> for people who have a long
        way for work, who love to travel or if you are just a lazy person. My teleport would work by scanning and
        <strong>monitoring</strong> a person’s body and save data that could be moved to another location. Of course,
        there may be some <strong>challenges</strong> and <strong>drawbacks</strong> to overcome, such as safety. But I
        think, with careful testing of this invention, <strong>implementation</strong> of it would be very good. I
        believe this device could <strong>make a big difference to people’s lives</strong>. As an inventor, I would
        believe that my invention is a <strong>brilliant idea</strong> and my creation would make a <strong>positive
            impact</strong> on people’s lives. This invention would be <strong>eco-friendly</strong>, and people should
        use it without fear of polluting the environment. In conclusion, I would like to say that if I were an inventor,
        people wouldn't be frustrated.
