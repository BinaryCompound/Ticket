    <h1 class="header"> my educational path</h1>
    <p class="info">I finish <strong>secondary school</strong> in 2020, i got a good <strong>grades</strong> and
        entered Economics university
        <strong>studied for</strong> linguistics. It was pandemic and that’s why i had
        <strong>distance
            learning</strong>. I thought that
        i would be a translator becouse it was interesting for me to <strong>learned new foreign
            language</strong>. But
        after the first course i understood that this profession not for me. Then i <strong>took a year out</strong>
        before
        next university and in this <strong>semester</strong> i transferred to Herzen university
        <strong>studied for</strong> filology.
        Now i <strong>study many subjects, discuss important problems at the seminars, take notes
            at the lectures,
            take test and examinations.</strong> Now I’m on <strong>face-to-face learning</strong> and it
        seems to me
        <strong>face-to-face
            interactions with teachers</strong> are more effective than <strong>distance learning</strong>
        .When i will <strong>graduate</strong>
        from university i will get a <strong>bachelor’s degree.</strong> I want to become a
        <strong>well-qualified</strong> specialist and
        be <strong>dedicated</strong> to my work.
