    <h1 class="header">The role of traditions in the modern world</h1>
    <p class="info">
        Traditions play an important role in the modern world. It seems to me, All traditions <strong>make a big
            difference to
            people’s lives</strong> and i think everyone should has traditions in their life. All traditions have
        <strong>positive impacts</strong>
        because they helps to save cultural heritage. That’s why i believe that it is important to <strong>pass the
            tradition
            down to the next generation</strong>. Traditions make bonds between generations stronger. Every family,
        every culture
        has their own traditions, for example they may <strong>decorate the house, they can cook special food, take part
            in the
            competitions</strong> and something like that. Traditions also make family members closer and creating
        respect for other
        cultures. Besides, traditions can be sources of joy and pleasure, for example different holidays. In my opinion,
        it is important to <strong>keep up</strong> traditions of your family or country because it helps people to save
        stability and
        sense of belonging. In conclusion i would like to say that the role of the traditions in modern word is very
        important. People should have any traditions. If they have them, their life will be better.
